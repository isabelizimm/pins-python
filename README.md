The pins package publishes data, models, and other python objects, making it
easy to share them across projects and with your colleagues. You can pin
objects to a variety of pin *boards*, including folders (to share on a
networked drive or with services like DropBox), RStudio Connect, and Amazon
S3.
Pins can be automatically versioned, making it straightforward to track changes,
re-run analyses on historical data, and undo mistakes.

## Installation

```shell
python -m pip install pins
```

## Usage
